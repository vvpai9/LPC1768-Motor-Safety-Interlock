 * The first pool is used to allocate memory from cacheable memory.
 * the second pool is used to allocate memory from memory that is not cached.
 * 
 * If the BSP memory manager is used, make sure the system initialization code
 * configures the MMU to to mark the DMA_MEMORY as non-cacheable.
 *
 * Also ensure the scatter file used for the project does not direct the linker
 * to locate code or data within either of these memory regions.

 * If the BSP is ported to an actual operating system, the BSP memory 
 * allocation routines should be directed to go through the underlying kernel.
